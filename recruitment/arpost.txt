Welcome!


Asset Recovery is looking for players of all aspects of New Eden!
Bitter Vets to brand new toons!
We Offer New Player help and guidance in any aspect of the game. Day one players will find a helpful group of players to learn from, and a home with the best part of the game!


We are currently set up in a HS system 4 jumps from Jita in The Citadel, in a system with reliable ice mining, (2 backup systems 2 jumps away) as well as access to the 2 best ores in Hi-Sec Plagioclase and Pyroxeres. We have a X% refinery Athanor as well as a Ritaru for blueprint research and invention.


We Firmly believe that Real Life comes first over anything in the game. Thus, we will never have any forced mining ops or any other fleet, event, or anything that we will REQUIRE you to log in and participate or be punished. Your Participation is always appreciated, but never forced. You play this game how you want to play the game!


We also firmly believe in having a Non-Toxic Environment, where we treat every Alliance member like a member of the family. Any and all toxic behavior will not be tolerated!


We are accepting Alpha accounts (even day old ones), although if you are a highly skilled veteran, then we can suggest our sister corporations in wspace (link)

Also, please note, We are a community starting from the ground up, We are not some giant mega group who always has something going on. Our activity is a bit low right now, and will remain as such until we grow more. This is a downside to small corps and alliances, however it also breeds Family, and Comradeship much quicker and family environments, at least in my opinion, breed a much better play experience.
