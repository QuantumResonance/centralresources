Welcome!


Vanishing Assets is looking for players of all aspects of New Eden!
Bitter Vets to brand new toons! We are recruiting players for Small Gang PVP, PvE and Industrial aspects of Eve.
We are building from the ground up a new Corporation, and a New Alliance headed by Vanishing Assets. We will start small, but grow to greatness!
We Offer New Player help and guidance in any aspect of the game. Day one players will find a helpful group of players to learn from, and a home with the best part of the game!
We offer a good system with plenty of moons for Moon Mining and PI !


We Firmly believe that Real Life comes first over anything in the game. Thus, we will never have any CTA's or any other fleet, event, or anything that we will REQUIRE you to log in and participate or be punished. Your Participation is always appreciated, but never forced. You play this game how you want to play the game!
We also firmly believe in having a Non-Toxic Environment, where we treat every Alliance member like a member of the family. Any and all toxic behavior will not be tolerated!




Also, please note, We are a community starting from the ground up, We are not some giant mega group who always has something going on. Our activity is a bit low right now, and will remain as such until we grow more. This is a downside to small corps and alliances, however it also breeds Family, and Comradeship much quicker and family environments, at least in my opinion, breed a much better play experience.
